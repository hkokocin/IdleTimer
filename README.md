# IdleTimer

A little pet project to play with architecture and technologies. Currently I am evaluating
* a redux like architecture. Although I do not think that going the whole way is a good idea on Android some core concepts merged with MVVM look quite promising to me. 
* using coroutines as a replacement for rx. 
* using Kodein over dagger
* heavily modularize the project for faster build times and the theoretical ability to integrate instant apps
